# Frequency Management Fuzzing Corpus

## Overview
This corpus contains test data for fuzzing frequency management in FGCom-mumble.

## Test Data Files
*Note: Frequency management corpus files are designed to test various frequency edge cases*

## Fuzzing Target
- **Binary**: `test/build-fuzz/fuzz_frequency_management`
- **Purpose**: Tests frequency management for:
  - Frequency allocation algorithms
  - Frequency conflict resolution
  - Frequency validation
  - Frequency coordination
  - Frequency interference detection

## Expected Behaviors
- Frequency allocation should be accurate
- Frequency conflicts should be resolved
- Frequency validation should be comprehensive
- Frequency coordination should be reliable
- Frequency interference should be detected

## Coverage Areas
- Frequency allocation algorithms
- Frequency conflict resolution
- Frequency validation
- Frequency coordination
- Frequency interference detection
- Frequency planning
- Frequency monitoring
- Frequency optimization
