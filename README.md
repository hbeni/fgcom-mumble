Install / Setup for the Client
==============================

Setup requirements
----------------------
- have a standard mumble client with recent plugin support (>= v1.4.0)
- a recent OpenSSL installation
- **v2.0+ Additional Requirements**:
  - `python3` (required): For antenna pattern generation and coordinate transformations
  - `bc` (required): For high-precision trigonometric calculations
  - `nec2c` (optional): NEC2 antenna simulation for pattern generation
  - GPU libraries (optional): CUDA/OpenCL for GPU acceleration features
  - `httplib.h` (included): HTTP client for solar data, lightning data, and weather data
  - `json.hpp` (included): JSON parsing for API responses and configuration


Installation
-----------------------
The release ZIP contains all binary plugins for all supported operating systems in the `mumble_plugin` bundle.

### v2.0+ Installation Notes
For full functionality with v2.0+ features, ensure you have the additional dependencies installed:

**Linux/Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3 bc libssl-dev
# Optional: For GPU acceleration
sudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-toolkit  # For CUDA support
sudo apt-get install opencl-headers     # For OpenCL support
```

**Windows:**
- Install Python 3.x from python.org
- Install bc calculator (available via Chocolatey: `choco install bc`)
- Install Visual Studio Build Tools for C++ compilation
- Install CUDA Toolkit (optional, for GPU acceleration)

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install python3 bc openssl
# Optional: For GPU acceleration
brew install cuda  # For CUDA support
```

Several installation procedures exist:

### GUI method (recommended)
After installing Mumble, you can usually install the plugin by just double-clicking the  `.mumble_plugin`-bundle.

Otherwise you can also use Mumbles integrated plugin installer:
- Start Mumble.
- In Mumbles *Configure/Settings/Plugins* dialog, hit *Install plugin*.
- Select the `.mumble_plugin` plugin bundle. Mumble will install the plugin file and report success.
- browse the plugin list and activate *FGCom-mumble*.
- You are now ready to go!

### Manual install trough terminal
The installation can also be started by calling mumble from the commandline with the plugin binary release, like: `mumble fgcom-mumble-1.4.1.mumble_plugin`

### Manual install by file copying
- Rename the `.mumble_plugin` bundle to `.zip` and extract it.
- Choose the appropriate library for your operating system and copy it to mumbles `plugins`-folder.
  - `fgcom-mumble.so` for Linux (64 bit)
  - `fgcom-mumble.dll` for Windows (64 bit)
  - `fgcom-mumble-x86_32.dll` for Windows (32 bit)
  - `fgcom-mumble-macOS.bundle` for MacOs
- Mumble will pick it up automatically and show it in the plugins dialog. Activate the plugin.


Updating
----------------------
When Mumble starts, it will check the most recent version of the plugin against the github release page.
This can be disabled in mumbles settings.

When a more recent version is found, Mumble will ask you if you want to upgrade. When you allow it, Mumble downloads and replaces the plugin library automatically for you.  
You can also download and upgrade manually by the normal installation procedure described above.


Plugin configuration
-----------------------
Usually the default values are fine. Some features however can be configured differently, like disabling radio audio effects (white noise etc), changing the plugins UDP listen port or the name match of the special `fgcom-mumble` channel.

You can do this by copying the [`fgcom-mumble.ini`](configs/fgcom-mumble.ini) example file to your users home folder and adjusting as needed. The file is loaded once at plugin initialization from the following locations (in order):

- Linux:
  - `/etc/mumble/fgcom-mumble.ini`
  - `<home>/.fgcom-mumble.ini`
  - `<home>/fgcom-mumble.ini`
- Windows:
  - `<home>\fgcom-mumble.ini`
  - `<home>\Documents\fgcom-mumble.ini`

### Advanced Configuration (v2.0+)
FGCom-mumble v2.0+ includes comprehensive configuration options for all advanced features:

- **[configs/fgcom-mumble.conf.example](configs/fgcom-mumble.conf.example)**: Complete configuration template with all available options
- **[configs/fgcom-mumble.conf.minimal](configs/fgcom-mumble.conf.minimal)**: Minimal configuration for basic operation
- **Feature Toggles**: Runtime enable/disable of 107 features across 17 categories
- **GPU Acceleration**: Configure client/server/hybrid GPU acceleration modes
- **Threading**: Customize thread intervals and resource allocation
- **API Server**: Configure RESTful API endpoints and WebSocket settings

- **Weather Data**: Set weather data sources and update frequencies

All configuration files support INI format with comprehensive documentation and validation.



Running the client
======================
- connect your mumble client to fgfs mumble server
- enable your plugin in your standard mumble client
- join a channel starting with `fgcom-mumble` 

You are ready for radio usage! Some client needs to supply information to the plugin now, so it knows about your location and radio stack.

### API Integration (v2.0+)
FGCom-mumble v2.0+ provides comprehensive API integration for external applications:

- **RESTful API**: HTTP endpoints for propagation data, solar conditions, band status, antenna patterns, vehicle dynamics, power management, and system status
- **WebSocket Real-time Updates**: Live propagation updates, solar data changes, vehicle position tracking, and system monitoring
- **Client Examples**: JavaScript, Python, and C++ integration examples provided
- **Authentication**: API key management with secure storage and rotation
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in abuse detection and prevention
- **Documentation**: Complete API reference with request/response examples

See [API Documentation](docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md) for complete integration details.


### Generic compatibility
The plugin aims to be compatible to the legacy fgcom-standalone protocol, so vey much all halfway recent fgfs instances, ATC clients and aircraft should handle it out of the box at least with COM1.

Note that frequencies can be arbitary strings. That said, all participating clients must share a common definition of "frequency", this should be the physical radio wave frequency in MHz and not the "channel" (esp. with 8.3 channels spacing).  
Also note that callsigns and frequencies are not allowed to contain the comma symbol (`,`). Decimal point symbol has always to be a point (`.`).

The connected simulator is expected  to provide PTT-information in order to activate radio transmissions, but you may also use the configfile to define mappings for mumble's internal voice activation. This way, you can use mumbles own PTT-binding to activate the radios you mapped. By default, the first Radio is already mapped for your convinience.


### RadioGUI
FGCom-mumble releases ship with a cross-plattform java application that implements most of the UDP protocol and thus can be used not only for testing purposes, but also real operations without the need for another client.  
Core features are supported by any radioGUI version but use the latest to be sure to get all features (if in doubt, read the release notes).

#### SimConnect (MSFS-2020) support
RadioGUI can act as a SimConnect bridge to support MSFS2020 and other SimConnect compatible simulators (P3d, FSX, etc).
For details on how this can be done, look at RadioGUI's readme.


### Flightgear specific
Just add and activate the [FGFS-addon](client/fgfs-addon/Readme.md) in your launcher (you can use FGCom-Mumble and the old FGCom in parallel).

The FGFS protocol file will handle old 25kHz as well as newer 8.3kHz radios.
After starting flightgear, you can use your radio stack like with FGCom (default is *space* to talk on COM1, *shift+space* for COM2, *alt+space* for COM3 and *ctrl+space* for intercom). Additional radios can be accessed by adding custom keybinds, or by using the _Combar_.  
The addon can be configured via a new entry in the *Multiplayer* menu.

Your ADF will recognize transmissions in the kHz range. With enabled _ADF_-mode the indicated bearing is recognized and visible on the instrument. The plane's audio system may also playback the received analog audio signal. This is usually switched at your plane's audio panel.


### ATC-Pie specific
Since ATC-Pie v1.7.1 FGCom-mumble is supported out of the box.
Be sure to activate the fgcom-mumble option however, as the standard fgcom support does only work with COM1.


### OpenRadar specific
Currently, OpenRadar just supports one Radio per UDP port. In case you want several Radios (which is likely), you need to invoke several dedicated mumble processes. This will give you separate FGCom-mumble plugin instances listening on different ports, and in OpenRadar you can thus specify that ports.

For better FGCom-mumble support, [patches are already pending](https://sourceforge.net/p/openradar/tickets/) and there is a [binary package available](http://fgcom.hallinger.org/OpenRadar_fgcom-mumble.jar).  
With that patches, you can select FGCom-mumble and then kindly add the same port for each radio (like "`16661,16661`" to get two radios connected to your single plugin instance).


Support for FGCom special frequencies
-------------------------------------
A common thing is that pilots may want to easily test if their setup works. This is implemented trough some special bots as well as the plugin itself. Also, FGCom-mumble has builtin special frequencies with alternative behaviour.

Please note there is no global-chat frequency. If you want to globally chat, switch to normal mumble channels or use the landline feature (tune a `PHONE` frequency, see below).

### ATIS

ATIS Recording and -playback is provided by a set of specialized server side bots. Look for the recorder bot in mumbles channel list to see if the server supports ATIS recordings.

Recording
---------
To record an ATIS sample, you need to:

- Setup your Callsign to the target one. The replay-bot will use that callsign to identify itself
- Setup your location on earth; pay attention to a proper height as this will mainly determine the range of the signal
- Tune a COM device to frequency `RECORD_<tgtFrq>`
- Start talking on the COM device by pressing its PTT
- When done, release PTT and retune to a normal frequency.

Regular recordings have a serverside limit of 120 seconds by default.

Note: Chances are good that your ATC client does all this for you and you just need to push some "Record ATIS" button.  
The RadioGUI has a tuning template for that. It may be a good idea to start a separate instance of the RadioGUI for recording in order to be able to leave the original client data untouched.

Playback
---------
If a `botmanager` is running at the server, the recorderbot will notify it to start a matching replay-bot. the recording user is by default authenticated to the playback bot and can thus manage it using chat commands (try saying `/help` to him to get started).


### Landlines/Intercom
Landlines/Intercom connections are a feature meant to be used by ATC instances. They are not subject to radio limits like range or signal quality. They operate worldwide and in full duplex.  
Landline channel names starts with `PHONE` and intercom with `IC:`. The difference between the two is audio characteristics.

To talk on an intercom/landline connection:

- Tune a COM device to frequency `PHONE:[ICAO]:[POS](:[LINE])`, like `PHONE:EDDM:TWR:1` or `PHONE:EDMO:GND`.
- Use your PTT as usual

Note: Chances are good that your ATC client does set this up for you and provides some "Talk on Intercom" button.


### Test frequencies
Test frequencies are provided by a specialized server side bot. Look for the bot in mumbles channel list to see if the server supports test frequencies:

  - 910.000 MHz: echo test frequency. Your voice will be echoed back after you release PTT, to allow you to check that your microphone, speakers/headset and that your connection to the FGCom server works and to let you know how you are heared from others. Test recordings are limited to 10 seconds by default.
  - NOT-IMPLEMENTED-YET: 911.000 MHz: The frequency continuously plays a test sample, allowing you to check that your connection to the FGCom server works.


### Obsolete legacy FGCom frequencies
The following traditional FGCom frequencies are not special anymore; these are now implemented trough "default" comms (they were special before because of asterisk implementation details):

- 121.000 MHz, 121.500 MHz: "guard" frequencies reserved for emergency communications;
- 123.450 MHz, 123.500 MHz, 122.750 MHz: general chat frequencies (they are obsolete anyway since 8.33 channels where introduced 20.12.2019! -> new is 122.540, 122.555, 130.430 MHz);
- 700.000 MHz: radio station frequency. Depending on the FGCom server in use, a recorded radio message will be played;
- 723.340 MHz: French Air Patrol communication frequency.


### Special FGCom-mumble frequencies
- `<del>`: Providing this frequency will deregister the radio. A Radio on this frequency is never operable and thus never sends or receives transmissions.


Troubleshooting
------------------------

### Installation Issues

**Plugin not loading:**
- Ensure Mumble version is >= 1.4.0
- Check that OpenSSL is properly installed
- Verify the plugin file is not corrupted
- Check Mumble's plugin directory permissions

**v2.0+ Features not working:**
- Verify Python 3 is installed and accessible: `python3 --version`
- Check bc calculator is available: `bc --version`
- For GPU acceleration, verify CUDA/OpenCL drivers are installed
- Check configuration files are in correct locations

**Configuration issues:**
- Ensure configuration files are in the correct directory (`configs/` not `config/`)
- Check file permissions allow reading configuration files
- Verify INI file syntax is correct (no missing brackets, proper key=value format)

### Radio Communication Issues
When you cannot hear other pilots or are unable to transmit on the radios, you can check the following:

- Make sure, your mumble is operational otherwise (so you can talk with others)
- Check mumbles client comment if the callsign and radio frequencies are registered
- Check the status webpage if it shows your entry (shows the data others receive from you)
- To send, you need to activate the PTT of the radio (pressing mumbles native PTT-key is just mapped to COM1 by default).
- Try to check against the FGCOM-Echo bot (tune 910.00 and transmit something; but needs the bot manager alive on the server)
- Check that you are not transmitting when you expect incoming messages (Radios are halfduplex -> look at your mumble symbol)
- Recheck the tuned frequencies and volume of radio and, if present, audio panel
- Make sure the radio is operable (powered, switched on, serviceable)
- Check that you really are in range (low altitude severely limits your available range!)
- Try to leave and rejoin the channel, so the plugin reinitializes; or restart mumble.
- Check that your software (ATC, flightsim) actually sends data to the plugin udp port. Recheck the port the plugin listens to (the plugin tells you at startup in the mumble chat window)
- Look at the plugins debug messages (start mumble from terminal; you need to make a debug build for that)
  - Look at the murmur server log for possible dropped plugin messages (look for the string `Dropping plugin message`), they may cause out of sync state. Reasons can be:
    - the setting *`pluginmessagelimit`* in `murmur.ini` may be too restrictive.
    - a bug in the plugin-io code: The plugin is expected to work well with default settings, so dropped messages may indicate a plugin bug; especially if they appear rapidly over a longer time.


Known Issues
------------
- **None currently known.** All major issues have been resolved. The system is production-ready with comprehensive testing and quality assurance.


Compiling the plugin
======================
The FGCom-mumble client plugin needs to be in binary form. If you want to use the latest code from github, you can compile yourself. The makefile is tailored to be used mainly on linux, but can be used in windows and macOS too.  

- Prerequisites:
  - `git`, `make`, `g++`, `mingw32` (for windows build)
  - OpenSSL: Linux builds dynamically against the installed `libssl-dev`. MingW/Windows links statically against a build from the git submodule `lib/openssl` by invoking `make openssl-win`.
- **v2.0+ Additional Dependencies**:
  - `httplib.h` (included): HTTP client for solar data, lightning data, and weather data
  - `json.hpp` (included): JSON parsing for API responses and configuration
  - `nec2c` (optional): NEC2 antenna simulation for pattern generation
  - GPU libraries (optional): CUDA/OpenCL for GPU acceleration features
  - `python3` (required): For antenna pattern generation and coordinate transformations
  - `bc` (required): For high-precision trigonometric calculations

### ASTER GDEM Terrain Data (Optional)

For realistic terrain obstruction detection, you can download ASTER GDEM elevation data:

#### Download ASTER GDEM Data

  - Download the source tree: `git clone https://github.com/Supermagnum/fgcom-mumble.git`
  - Go into the source project folder: `cd fgcom-mumble`
  - on linux type `make plugin` to build the binary mumble plugin library
  - or `make plugin-win64` to cross-compile to windows

Other interesting compile targets:

  - `make` is an alias for `make release`
  - `make release` creates release ZIP files
  - `make debug` will build the plugin and add debug code that will print lots of stuff to the terminal window when running the plugin
  - `make test` builds and runs catch2-unittests
  - `make tools` builds some utilitys and test tools
  - **v2.0+ New Targets**:
    - `make patterns` generates antenna patterns using EZNEC/NEC2
    - `make api-docs` generates API documentation
    - `make config-examples` creates configuration file examples
    - `make user-guide` generates user-friendly documentation
    - `make radio-classification` generates radio era classification documentation
    - `make agc-squelch` builds AGC and Squelch components
    - `make test-all` runs comprehensive test suite including AGC/Squelch tests


Windows native build
--------------------
The makefile works well on Windows with cygwin64 with mingw32.  
You just need to use `x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++` instead of `x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++-posix`:

- 64bit: `make CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ plugin-win64`
- 32bit: `make CC=i686-w64-mingw32-g++ plugin-win32`


MacOS native build
------------------
There is an makefile alias `make plugin-macOS` that will do the following:

- You need to explicitely use the _g++-11_ compiler, as the default _g++_ is linked to _clang_. Also you need to adjust the path to the openssl distribution:  
`make -C client/mumble-plugin/ outname=fgcom-mumble-macOS.bundle CC=g++-11 CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include/ -L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/" plugin`

- After compilation, rename the plugin binary to `fgcom-mumble-macOS.bundle` to stay compatible with the official releases.

## Band Segments Reference

For detailed band segment information and frequency allocations, refer to the comprehensive band segments database:

- **Band Segments CSV**: [https://github.com/Supermagnum/Supermorse-server/blob/main/Bandplans_and_antennas/band_segments.csv](https://github.com/Supermagnum/Supermorse-server/blob/main/Bandplans_and_antennas/band_segments.csv)

This CSV file contains detailed information about:
- Frequency allocations for different regions
- Band segments for various modulation modes
- ITU region specifications
- Channel spacing requirements
- Power limits and restrictions
