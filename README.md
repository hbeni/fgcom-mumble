FGCom-mumble - a flightsim radio simulation framework based on mumble
=====================================================================

<img src="server/statuspage/inc/fgcom_logo.png" width="100px" align="left" />
This project aims to provide a modular, mumble based radio simulation for flight simulators. The project startet mainly as a successor for the asterisk based FGCom implementation.

### The main goals are:
- Provide communication with geographic and channel separation
- Provide a realistic radio simulation
- Ease of use for the end user / pilot
- Arbitary frequency support
- ATIS recording and playback
- Radio station broadcast support
- Landline/Intercom support
- RDF detection for clients
- Ease of server side installation and operation
- Standalone nature (no dependency on flightgear)
- Capability to be integrated into flightgear, with the option to support third party applications (ATC, but also other flightsims)
- Modularity, so individual component implementations can be switched and its easy to add features
- Good and complete documentation

Install / Setup for the Client
==============================

Setup requirements
----------------------
- have a standard mumble client with recent plugin support (>= v1.4.0)
- a recent OpenSSL installation


Installation
-----------------------
- The release ZIP contains all binary plugins for all supported operating systems:
  - `fgcom-mumble.so` for Linux (64 bit)
  - `fgcom-mumble.dll` for Windows (64 bit)
- Copy the plugin for your operating system to mumbles `plugins`-folder. Mumble will pick it up automatically and show it in the plugins dialog.  
The installation can also be started by calling mumble from the commandline with the plugin binary release, like: `mumble fgcom-mumble-client-binOnly-0.7.0.zip`


Plugin configuration
-----------------------
Usually the default values are fine. Some features however can be configured differently, like disabling radio audio effects (white noise etc), changing the plugins UDP listen port or the name match of the special `fgcom-mumble` channel.

You can do this by copying the [`fgcom-mumble.ini`](client/mumble-plugin/fgcom-mumble.ini) example file to your users home folder and adjusting as needed. The file is loaded once at plugin initialization.



Running the client
======================
- connect your mumble client to fgfs mumble server
- enable your plugin in your standard mumble client
- join a channel starting with `fgcom-mumble` or with `fgcom-mumble activated` in its description. 

You are ready for radio usage! Some client needs to supply information to the plugin now, so it knows about your location and radio stack.


### Generic compatibility
The plugin aims to be compatible to the legacy fgcom-standalone protocol, so vey much all halfway recent fgfs instances, ATC clients and aircraft should handle it out of the box at least with COM1.

Note that frequencies can be arbitary strings. That said, all participating clients must share a common definition of "frequency", this should be the physical radio wave frequency in MHz and not the "channel" (esp. with 8.3 channels spacing).  
Also note that callsigns and frequencies are not allowed to contain the comma symbol (`,`). Decimal point symbol has always to be a point (`.`).


### RadioGUI
FGCom-mumble releases ship with a cross-plattform java application that implements most of the UDP protocol and thus can be used not only for testing purposes, but also real operations without the need for another client.  
Core features are supported by any radioGUI version but use the latest to be sure to get all features (if in doubt, read the release notes).


### Flightgear specific
- copy the `fgcom-mumble.xml` fightgear protocol file to your flightgears `Protocol` folder.
- start flightgear with enabled fgcom-mumble protocol (add "`--generic=socket,out,10,127.0.0.1,16661,udp,fgcom-mumble`" to your launcher)
- start using your radio stack (standard FGCom PTT is space for COM1 and shift-space for COM2)

The FGFS protocol file will handle old 25kHz as well as newer 8.3kHz radios.


### ATC-Pie specific
Since ATC-Pie v1.7.1 FGCom-mumble is supported out of the box.


### OpenRadar specific
Currently, OpenRadar just supports one Radio per UDP port. In case you want several Radios (which is likely), you need to invoke several dedicated mumble processes. This will give you separate FGCom-mumble plugin instances listening on different ports, and in OpenRadar you can thus specify that ports.

For better FGCom-mumble support, [patches are already pending](https://sourceforge.net/p/openradar/tickets/) and there is a [binary package available](https://github.com/hbeni/openradar/releases).  
With that patches, you can select FGCom-mumble and then kindly add the same port for each radio (like "`16661,16661`" to get two radios connected to your single plugin instance).


Support for FGCom special frequencies
-------------------------------------
A common thing is that pilots may want to easily test if their setup works. This is implemented trough some special bots as well as the plugin itself. Also, FGCom-mumble has builtin special frequencies with alternative behaviour.

Please note there is no global-chat frequency. If you want to globally chat, switch to normal mumble channels or use the landline feature (tune a `PHONE` frequency, see below).

### ATIS Recording
ATIS Recording is provided by a specialized server side bot. Look for the bot in mumbles channel list to see if the server supports ATIS recordings.

To record an ATIS sample, you need to:

- Setup your Callsign to the target one. The replay-bot will use that callsign to identify itself
- Setup your location on earth; pay attention to a proper height as this will mainly determine the range of the signal
- Tune a COM device to frequency `RECORD_<tgtFrq>`
- Start talking on the COM device by pressing its PTT
- When done, release PTT and retune to a normal frequency.

Regular recordings have a serverside limit of 120 seconds by default.

Note: Chances are good that your ATC client does all this for you and you just need to push some "Record ATIS" button.  
The RadioGUI has a tuning template for that. It may be a good idea to start a separate instance of the RadioGUI for recording in order to be able to leave the original client data untouched.

### Landlines/Intercom
Landlines/Intercom connections are a feature meant to be used by ATC instances. They are not subject to radio limits like range or signal quality. They operate worldwide.

To talk on an intercom/landline connection:

- Tune a COM device to frequency `PHONE:[ICAO]:[POS](:[LINE])`, like `PHONE:EDDM:TWR:1` or `PHONE:EDMO:GND`.
- Use your PTT as usual

Note: Chances are good that your ATC client does set this up for you and provides some "Talk on Intercom" button.


### Test frequencies
Test frequencies are provided by a specialized server side bot. Look for the bot in mumbles channel list to see if the server supports Test frequencies.

  - 910.000 MHz: echo test frequency. Your voice will be echoed back after you release PTT, to allow you to check that your microphone, speakers/headset and that your connection to the FGCom server works and to let you know how you are heared from others. Test recordings are limited to 10 seconds by default.
  - NOT-IMPLEMENTED-YET: 911.000 MHz: The frequency continuously plays a test sample, allowing you to check that your connection to the FGCom server works.


### Obsolete legacy FGCom frequencies
The following traditional FGCom frequencies are not special anymore; these are now implemented trough "default" comms (they were special before because of asterisk implementation details).

- 121.000 MHz, 121.500 MHz: "guard" frequencies reserved for emergency communications;
- 123.450 MHz, 123.500 MHz, 122.750 MHz: general chat frequencies (they are obsolete anyway since 8.33 channels where introduced 20.12.2019! -> new is 122.540, 122.555, 130.430 MHz);
- 700.000 MHz: radio station frequency. Depending on the FGCom server in use, a recorded radio message will be played;
- 723.340 MHz: French Air Patrol communication frequency;


###  Special FGCom-mumble frequencies
- `<del>`: Providing this frequency will deregister the radio. A Radio on this frequency is never operable and thus never sends or receives transmissions.


Troubleshooting
------------------------
When you cannot hear other pilots or are unable to transmit on the radios, you can check the following:

- Make sure, your mumble is operational otherwise (so you can talk with others)
- Try to check against the FGCOM-Echo bot (tune 910.00 and transmit something; but needs the bot manager alive on the server)
- Check that you are not transmitting when you expect incoming messages (Radios are halfduplex -> look at your mumble symbol)
- Recheck the tuned frequencies and volume of radio and, if present, audio panel
- Make sure the radio is operable (powered, switched on, serviceable)
- Check that you really are in range (low altitude severely limits your available range!)
- Try to leave and rejoin the channel, so the plugin reinitializes
- Check that your software (ATC, flightsim) actually sends data to the plugin udp port. Recheck the port the plugin listens to (the plugin tells you at startup in the mumble chat window)
- Check mumbles client comment if the callsign and radio frequencies are registered
- Look at the plugins debug messages (start mumble from terminal; you need to make a debug build for that)
- Look at the murmur server log for possible dropped plugin messages (look for the string `Dropping plugin message`), they may cause out of sync state. Reasons can be:
  - the setting *`pluginmessagelimit`* in `murmur.ini`  may be too restrictive.
  - a bug in the plugin-io code: The plugin is expected to work well with default settings, so dropped messages may indicate a plugin bug; especially if they appear rapidly over a longer time.


Compiling the plugin
======================
The FGCom-mumble client plugin needs to be in binary form. If you want to use the latest code from github, you can compile yurself.  

- Prerequisites:
  - `git`, `make`, `g++`, `mingw32` (for windows build)
  - OpenSSL: Linux builds dynamically against the installed `libssl-dev`. MingW/Windows links statically against a build from the git submodule `lib/openssl` by invoking `make openssl-win`.

- Building:
  - Go to the folder `client/mumble-plugin/`
  - on linux type `make`
  - or `make all-win64` to cross-compile to windows

Other interesting compile targets:

  - `make` is an alias for `make all`
  - `make all` builds for linux: the libs, the plugins and the test tools in test directory
  - `make all-debug` will build that too but add
 debug code that will print lots of stuff to the terminal window when running the plugin
  - `make plugin` will build just the the plugin for linux
  - `make plugin-win64` will build it for windows
  - `make release` builds zip release files containing linux/windows binaries
