# Integrsts Fuzzing Corpains test data for fuzzing system integration in FGCom-mumble.

## Test Data Files
*Note: Integration tests corpus files are designed to test various system integration edge cases*

## Fuzzing Target
- **Binary**: `test/build-fuzz/fuzz_integration_tests`
- **Purpose**: Tests system integration for:
  - Component interaction testing
  - System-wide functionality
  - Integration point validation
  - System compatibility
  - End-to-end testing

## Expected Behaviors
- Component interactions should be reliable
- System-wide functionality should be robust
- Integration points should be validated
- System compatibility should be maintained
- End-to-end testing should be comprehensive

## Coverage Areas
- Component interaction testing
- System-wide functionality
- Integration point validation
- System compatibility
- End-to-end testing
- System integration
- Component communication
