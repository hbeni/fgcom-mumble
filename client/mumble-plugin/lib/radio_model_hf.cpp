/**
 * A HF based radio model for the FGCom-mumble plugin
 *
 * The model implements basic high frequency propagation (between 3 and 30 MHz).
 * Currently this is a simple model that justs takes distance and wattage into account.
 * Transmissions behind the radio horizon travel via ground waves, we simulate this by applying some loss to the signal.
 * TODO: advanced stuff like influences of day/night, terminator, sun spots, etc are not modelled yet.
