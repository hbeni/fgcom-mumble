=== KEY FINDINGS ===

1. Most 'system' findings are false positives (variable names)
2. Real vulnerabilities found in node_modules (external dependencies)
3. Some strcpy usage in opus library (external dependency)
4. Buffer boundary checks needed in some file I/O operations

=== RECOMMENDATIONS ===

1. Review and fix buffer boundary checks in file I/O operations
2. Consider updating external dependencies with known vulnerabilities
3. Add input validation for all user inputs
4. Implement proper error handling for all system calls
5. Consider using safer alternatives to risky functions
